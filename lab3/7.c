// Description: This program demonstrates the issue of using shared memory in
// threads
#include <pthread.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

/*
 * Observations:
 * 10 Threads are created and values of i that are passed change on each
 * execution due to a race condition. Becuase the threads are passed a reference
 * to i and not the value of i itself, each thread prints the iteration number
 * that the main thread is currently and not always the iteration it is created
 * on due to the fact that threads share memory with the main process.
 *
