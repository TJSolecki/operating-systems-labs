// Title: Lab4 â€“ Step 1
// Description: This program demonstrates the usage pthread and serves as an
// example of pre-tread variables vs shared-memory variables
#include <pthread.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

/*
 * Observations:
 * Step 1:
 * When I run the program I notice that a different number of threads actually
 * run each time, most often 19 or 20. This is because the main thread does not
 * wait for the threads to complete running so the program can exit before some
 * of the threads can start processing. None of the threads "complete" per say
 * since each thread has a 15 second call to sleep, but the program finishes
 * executing in under a second.
 *
 * Step 2:
 * The parameter arg in the go function is a per-thread variable. Each thread
 * recives a copy of i arg. The compiler stores the value of arg on the stack
 * of each thread.
 *
 * Step 3:
 * The variable i in the main function is a per-thread variable. The variable
 * that is created is stored on the stack of the main therad but is copied to
 * other threads on each iteration in the call to pthread.
 *
